    <h1>Quick hummus recipe</h1>

    <p>This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. <strong>It has been adapted from a number of different
        recipes that I
        have read over the years.</strong></p>

    <p>Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad,
        grilled meats and pitta breads.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <p><em>1 can (400g) of chick <small>peas</small> (garbanzo beans)<br>
        175g of <q>little</q>tahini<br>
        6 sundried tomatoes<br>
        <ins>Half</ins> a red pepper<br>
        A <mark>pinch of cayenne</mark> pepper<br>
        1 clove of garlic<br>
        A dash of olive oil<br>
    </em></p>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <p>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely<br>
        Remove <em>all</em> the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely<br>
        Add all the ingredients into a food processor<br>
        Pro<sup>cess</sup> all the ingredients into a paste.<br>
        If you want a coarse <strong>"chunky"</strong> hummus, process it for a short time<br>
        If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time<br>
    </p>

    <p>For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and
        chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. <strong>Experiment and see what works for you.</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>Storage</h2>

    <p>Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it <em>for about a week after
        you've
        made it. </em>If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.</p>

    <p>Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.</p>
